/*
  Author: AndrÃ© Kreienbring  
  Implements general methods to request data with Axios. 
  Including a 'challenge - response' cycle for retrieving information 
  from a password protected Shelly device.
  The original code was copied from an Allterco example here:
  https://github.com/ALLTERCO/gen2-sample-code.

  Basically: The first request is a 'normal' request for an rpc method provided by 
  the device. (challenge) If the device is protected, it will send a "not Authorized" status code
  of 401. The used security algorithm will be extracted from the header and the given information 
  will be enhanced with the user credentials before sending the authorized request again. (response)

  This module uses 'axios' to implement this cycle.
