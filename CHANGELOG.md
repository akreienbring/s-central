- Log capturing is now more robust
- Added two example scripts (Example, Watchdog) that demonstrate:
  - how to log output that is captured by the Shellybroker server
  - hot to use the webservice endpoints of the Shellybroker
  - how script Errors are detected and send to the Shellybroker as notification
